- 👋 Hi, I’m @HTSFberkeley
- 👀 I’m interested in creating image analysis programs that allow our great automated imagers to have their images analysis through freeware options (Cell Profiler, Python code, MatLab, etc.)
- 🌱 I’m currently working a Github program that creates flatfield (background and foreground) corrected images and saves them to a folder for next steps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on linking this folder to more sophisticated programs for analyzing 3D images.
- 📫 How to reach me mwest@berkeley.edu
